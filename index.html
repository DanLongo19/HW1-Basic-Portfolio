        <p>My name is Dan Longo and I grew up in Madison, WI. I've lived in Chicago for almost 8 years, and really enjoy
            the big city. My favorite things to do are go for long runs, try new restaurants and meet up with friends.</p>
       
        <p>I have 2 sisters and a little brother who also live in Chicago. My sisters have 2 two year old boys who I
            love to hang out with as much as possible, and I am very close with my brother. We all like to get together
            as much as possi which is really nice</p>
        
        <p>I also have an older brother who lives in Madison with his wife and their almost 1 year old daughter. 
            I'm excited to celebrate my neice's 1st birthday party on April 13th!</p>
        
        <p>I got married last November, and live with my wife and brother in law (he and I were friends before I
            ever met her, so it's not as odd as it sounds) near the North/Clybourn red line stop. We are looking
            forward to the summer and when we can walk comfortably around the neighborhood and hang out by the pool.</p>
