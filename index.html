        <p>My name is Dan Longo and I grew up in Madison, WI. I've lived in Chicago for almost 8 years, and really enjoy
            the big city. My favorite things to do are go for long runs, try new restaurants, meet up with friends, and when I'm not doing those things I pretend to be a coder.</p>
       
        <p>I have 2 sisters and a little brother who also live in Chicago. My sisters have 2 two year old boys who I
            love to hang out with as much as possible, and I am very close with my brother. We all like to get together
            as much as possible, which is really nice</p>
        
        <p>I also have an older brother who lives in Madison with his wife and their 1 year old daughter.</p>
        
        <p>I got married last November, and plan on moving to Grand Rapids, MI where she grew up. It will be nice to be close to her family, and I'm excited to check out a new city and start our forever home together!
